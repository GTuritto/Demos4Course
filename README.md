# Demos4Course: AI-Agent and Multi-Agent Systems Demos
This repository contains demos created to illustrate the concepts of AI-Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. This project was created as part of the [AI4Devs](https://www.lidr.co/ia-devs) for [LIDR](https://www.lidr.co/) course, to understand the orchestration and collaboration of multiple intelligent agents working together to solve tasks.

---

## Demo1
### Participants:
- **User:** Initiates the process by sending a request through a proxy agent.
- **UserProxyAgent** (proxy_usuario): Acts as an intermediary for user commands, passing them to the **Assistant Agent** and handling code execution.
- **AssistantAgent** (asistente): Responsible for responding to the user's commands. It uses the Mistral API for its configuration.

### Sequence Flow:
1. **UserProxyAgent** receives a message from the user: *"Plot the YTD Bitcoin prices in Euros and volume of transactions Bitcoin_YTD.png.*"
2. **UserProxyAgent** forwards the message to **AssistantAgent** (asistente).
3. **AssistantAgent** processes the request, generates a code to plot the Bitcoin YTD prices, and passes it to the LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor for execution.
	- The LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor executes the code in the specified directory (contenido).
After execution, the code saves the generated image (Bitcoin_YTD.png) in the filesystem.

	The script tries to display the image from the Filesystem using the IPython.display.Image class. If the image is found, it is displayed, otherwise, an error message is printed.

    User ->> UserProxyAgent: Send message: "Plot the YTD Bitcoin prices..."
    UserProxyAgent ->> AssistantAgent: Forward message to AssistantAgent
    AssistantAgent ->> LocalCommandLineExecutor: Generate and execute code to plot Bitcoin prices
    LocalCommandLineExecutor ->> Filesystem: Save Bitcoin_YTD.png
    Filesystem ->> LocalCommandLineExecutor: Acknowledge image saved
    LocalCommandLineExecutor ->> UserProxyAgent: Notify that code execution is done
    UserProxyAgent ->> Filesystem: Attempt to retrieve Bitcoin_YTD.png
    Filesystem ->> UserProxyAgent: Image found
    UserProxyAgent ->> User: Display image
    alt Image not found
        Filesystem ->> UserProxyAgent: FileNotFoundError
        UserProxyAgent ->> User: Print "Image not found."
    end

```

### Explanation:
1. UserProxyAgent forwards the userâ€™s request to AssistantAgent.
2. AssistantAgent generates a code based on the user's request and passes it to the
3. LocalCommandLineExecutor to execute it.
	- The LocalCommandLineExecutor saves the generated image in the Filesystem.

- User then retrieves the image from the Filesystem and either displays it or prints an error message if the file is not found.


## Demo2
### Participants:
- **User** (External actor interacting with the system)
- **UserProxyAgent** (Proxy for the human input)
- **Product Manager** (PM) (Collaborates in Phase 1)
- **Business Analyst** (BA) (Collaborates in Phase 1)
- **Architect** (Collaborates in Phase 2)
- **Coder** (Collaborates in Phase 2)
- **QA** (Collaborates in Phase 2)
- **Documentation Agent** (Responsible for collecting and finalizing the documentation)

### Sequence Flow:
1. **User** sends an initial message via **UserProxyAgent**: The user initializes the conversation with the group chat by providing the message: *"We are designing a new clone of Jira, we want to include AI in order to help with the creation of Tickets and assigning to the right person."*.
3. **Phase 1:** **Product Manager** and **Business Analyst** collaboration:
- **Product Manager** responds with product requirements and contributes to the documentation through the Documentation Agent.
- **Business Analyst** responds with business requirements and use cases, also contributing to the Documentation Agent.
3. **Phase 2:** **Coder**, **Architect**, and **QA** collaboration:
- **Coder** responds with the implementation plan and contributes it to the Documentation Agent.
- **Architect** responds with architectural decisions and contributes it to the Documentation Agent.
- **QA** responds with the testing plan and contributes to the Documentation Agent.
4. **Phase 3:** Self-reflection and Peer Review:
Each agent (except **UserProxyAgent** and **Documentation_Agent**) reflects on their contribution and suggests improvements.
Each agent also peer-reviewed other agents' contributions; their feedback was stored in the documentation.
5. **Final Documentation Generation:** After the collaboration phases, the **Documentation Agent** generates the final document by compiling all contributions, self-reflections, and peer reviews.

### Key Interactions:
1. **UserProxyAgent** sends an initial message to the **GroupChat**.
2. **GroupChat** coordinates the collaboration phases, requesting contributions from different agents (**PM**, **BA**, **Architect**, **Coder**, **QA**).
3. Each agent sends its contribution to the **Documentation Agent**.
4. In **Phase 3**, agents contribute self-reflections and peer reviews, which are also stored in the final document by the **Documentation Agent**.

## How to Get Started
To clone the repository and set up your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Demos4Course.git
cd Demos4Course
```

2. Set up environment variables by creating a .env file with your API keys:

```makefile
MISTRAL_API_KEY=<your-mistral-api-key>
```

You can obtain the API key for Mistral at <https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/>. So, as you know, you will need a Mistral.ai account.
