# Demos4Course: AI-Agent and Multi-Agent Systems Demos
This repository contains demos created to illustrate the concepts of AI-Agents and Multi-Agent Systems. This project was created as part of the [AI4Devs](https://www.lidr.co/ia-devs) for [LIDR](https://www.lidr.co/) course, to understand the orchestration and collaboration of multiple intelligent agents working together to solve tasks.

## Demo1
### Participants:
- **User:** Initiates the process by sending a request through a proxy agent.
- **UserProxyAgent** (proxy_usuario): Acts as an intermediary for user commands, passing them to the **Assistant Agent** and handling code execution.
- **AssistantAgent** (asistente): Responsible for responding to the user's commands. It uses the Mistral API for its configuration.

### Sequence Flow:
1. **UserProxyAgent** receives a message from the user: *"Plot the YTD Bitcoin prices in Euros and volume of transactions Bitcoin_YTD.png.*"
2. **UserProxyAgent** forwards the message to **AssistantAgent** (asistente).
3. **AssistantAgent** processes the request, generates a code to plot the Bitcoin YTD prices, and passes it to the LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor for execution.
	- The LocalCommandLineCodeExecutor executes the code in the specified directory (contenido).
After execution, the code saves the generated image (Bitcoin_YTD.png) in the filesystem.

	The script tries to display the image from the Filesystem using the IPython.display.Image class. If the image is found, it is displayed, otherwise, an error message is printed.

    participant Filesystem

    User ->> UserProxyAgent: Send message: "Plot the YTD Bitcoin prices..."
    UserProxyAgent ->> AssistantAgent: Forward message to AssistantAgent
    AssistantAgent ->> LocalCommandLineExecutor: Generate and execute code to plot Bitcoin prices
    LocalCommandLineExecutor ->> Filesystem: Save Bitcoin_YTD.png
    Filesystem ->> LocalCommandLineExecutor: Acknowledge image saved
    LocalCommandLineExecutor ->> UserProxyAgent: Notify that code execution is done
    UserProxyAgent ->> Filesystem: Attempt to retrieve Bitcoin_YTD.png
    Filesystem ->> UserProxyAgent: Image found
    UserProxyAgent ->> User: Display image
    alt Image not found
        Filesystem ->> UserProxyAgent: FileNotFoundError
        UserProxyAgent ->> User: Print "Image not found."
    end

```

### Explanation:
1. UserProxyAgent forwards the userâ€™s request to AssistantAgent.
2. AssistantAgent generates a code based on the user's request and passes it to the
3. LocalCommandLineExecutor to execute it.
	- The LocalCommandLineExecutor saves the generated image in the Filesystem.

- User then retrieves the image from the Filesystem and either displays it or prints an error message if the file is not found.

### Key Components:

1. **User**: Initiates the project request by providing a description.
2. **UserProxyAgent**: Represents the user and forwards the project description and requests to other agents.
3. **Project Manager (PM)**: Responsible for creating a detailed delivery plan with milestones, timelines, and resource allocation.
4. **Product Manager (Product_Manager)**: Creates the Product Requirements Document (PRD) detailing the project's features and objectives.
5. **Business Analyst (BA)**: Document use cases and create a diagram of them.
6. **Architect**: Designs the system architecture using C4 and Mermaid diagrams.
7. **Coder**: Prepares a detailed implementation plan focusing on best coding practices and efficient algorithms.
8. **QA**: Creates a testing plan, including functional, integration, and regression testing, and provides BDD specifications in Gherkin.
9. **Documentation Agent**: This person is responsible for compiling contributions from other agents and generating the final project documentation.
10. **GroupChat**: Coordinates and manages communication among agents during the project.
11. **GroupChatManager**: Orchestrates the workflow of the group chat, ensuring smooth communication and task execution.

### Sequence Flow:

1. **User provides a project description**: The user is asked to describe the project.
2. **UserProxyAgent forwards the project description**: The description is passed to the group chat, where different agents contribute based on their roles.
3. **Phase 1: Contributions from various agents**:
    - **Product Manager** contributes the PRD.
    - **Business Analyst** contributes use cases and a use case diagram.
    - **Architect** contributes to the system architecture.
    - **Coder** contributes an implementation plan.
    - **QA** contributes to the testing plan and BDD specifications.
    - **Project Manager** contributes to the delivery plan.
4. **Documentation Agent compiles the contributions**: The documentation agent collects all contributions from the agents.
5. **Asynchronous document generation**: The documents are generated asynchronously for each section (PRD, use cases, architecture, implementation plan, etc.).

### Explanation of the Code Flow:

1. **Loading environment variables**: The code first loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `load_dotenv()`. These variables are used to configure the API keys for the Mistral and OpenAI APIs.
2. **LLM Configuration**: Three configurations for the language model (LLM) are created with different temperature settings (`high`, `normal`, and `low`), each representing different creativity levels (e.g., higher temperature for creative tasks, lower temperature for structured tasks).
3. **Agent Initialization**: Various agents are initialized, each responsible for a specific aspect of the project. The agents are configured using the Mistral API and their respective system messages, which define their responsibilities.
    - **UserProxyAgent**: Handles user requests and code execution.
    - **Product Manager, Business Analyst, Architect, Coder, QA, Project Manager**: Specialized agents contribute to different project documents.
    - **Documentation Agent**: Collects contributions and generates the final project documents.
4. **Group Chat and Manager Setup**: The group chat and manager (`GroupChatManager`) are initialized, managing the agents' interactions and communications.
5. **Project Workflow**:
    - The project workflow starts when the user provides a description of the project.
    - The `UserProxyAgent` sends this description to the group chat, prompting contributions from various agents.
    - Each agent contributes content (e.g., PRD, use cases, architecture) to the **Documentation Agent**, which compiles everything.
    - The contributions are generated asynchronously and saved to the filesystem as markdown files.
6. **Asynchronous Document Generation**: The final project documents are generated asynchronously, ensuring non-blocking execution and allowing agents to work simultaneously.

### Summary:

This code sets up a collaborative environment where multiple AI agents contribute to different aspects of a project (e.g., planning, documentation, testing). The agents operate in phases, and their outputs are compiled into a final set of project documents. The asynchronous execution ensures efficient handling of multiple tasks, while retries and error handling provide resilience in the process.

## How to Get Started
To clone the repository and set up your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Demos4Course.git
cd Demos4Course
```

2. Set up environment variables by creating a .env file with your API keys:

```makefile
MISTRAL_API_KEY=<your-mistral-api-key>
```

You can obtain the API key for Mistral at <https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys/>. So, as you know, you will need a Mistral.ai account.
